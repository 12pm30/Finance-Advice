Total monthly income = 5000
budget = 2000
Savings Intended = 3000
amount needed to spend 7 months from now = 15000

MY LOGIC: Spend 40% from your savings intended, remaining from budget.

So in this case, in order to pay off the loans in 7 (init) months, you need to save 15000/7 for each month ($2142.8)

To save for this spending per month, use 60% of savings first which is 0.60 * 3000 = 1800
Remaining is 2142.8 - 1800 = 342.8

Now we have 2 cases: 

1. If the remaining amount is less than 20% of the total budget
This remaining  will be spent from the budget. So the new budget for the next 7 months will be 2000 - 342.8 = 1657.2


2. If the remaining spending would have been more than 20% of total budget,
Then the user will do the following.
He will pay 20% of the budget for the number of months which is = (Remaining amount * init months / (20% of the budget))
